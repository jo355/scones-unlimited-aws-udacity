# Scones Unlimited ML Workflow on Sagemaker

This repository contains the submission files for **Course 4: Developing your first ML Workflow**. This is the final project in the Udacity nanodegree,**AWS ML Fundamentals**. The project is a production-style demo that trains and deploys an **image classifier** to distinguish **bicycles** from **motorcycles** using **AWS SageMaker**, wraps it with **Lambda functions**, orchestrates with **AWS Step Functions**, and captures inference traffic for monitoring.
